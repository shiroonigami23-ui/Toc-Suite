**[🚀 Launch Unified Studio](https://shiroonigami23-ui.github.io/Toc-Suite/)**

A mathematically precise, high-performance web environment for constructing, simulating, and analyzing formal languages and automata.

## 🛠 Project Architecture

The **Toc-Suite** is designed with a "Source of Truth" methodology. The front-end renders machines based on aggregated JSON libraries, while the back-end (GitHub Actions) manages data integrity.

### 📁 Directory Structure
* **`/automata`**: The permanent archive. Contains subfolders (`/fa`, `/pda`, `/mm`, `/tm`) where individual machine source files are stored.
* **`/Data`**: The ingestion port. Drop new `.json` files here to trigger the automated sorting pipeline.
* **`library.json` (Root)**: The live production libraries generated by CI/CD for the web app to consume.

### 🤖 CI/CD & Machine Intelligence
The repository is powered by a custom Python-driven GitHub Action (`build-library.yml`) that automates the following:
1.  **Auto-Sorting**: Detects the `type` in new JSON files and moves them from `/Data` to the correct subfolder.
2.  **Structural Validation**: Rejects any machine with broken transitions or missing states.
3.  **Deduplication**: Merges files into root libraries while ensuring unique entries based on `id` or `title`.
4.  **Logging**: New additions are automatically logged into the **[Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)**.

## 🔬 Core Studio Features

### 1. Finite Automata (FA) Studio
Full support for **DFA, NFA, and ε-NFA**. Features include automated conversion (ε-NFA → NFA → DFA → Minimal DFA) and a real-time **Logic Explorer** table.

### 2. Output Machines (MM) Studio
A specialized environment for **Mealy and Moore Machines**. Supports bidirectional conversion and live I/O trace visualizations.

### 3. Pushdown Automata (PDA) Studio
Advanced stack-based simulation with visual stack tracking and transition logic tables.

### 4. Turing Machine (TM) Studio
Standard TM simulation with tape visualization and multi-state logic monitoring.
